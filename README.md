This model is a Deep Learning based credit card fraud detection system. It uses a library 
called TensorFlow which is used for deep learning models. 

Credit card fraud datasets are highly imbalanced, with a small fraction of transactions being 
fraudulent. Handling imbalanced data is a crucial challenge in fraud detection.

Credit card fraud detection datasets 
typically include a wide range of features that can help identify fraudulent transactions, while the 
specific features may vary depending on the dataset.

The dataset consists of multiple features like Transaction amount, Transaction type, Time 
of transaction, Merchant ID, Merchant country, Merchant state, Number of previous 
transactions, Average transaction amount, Number of transactions within a time window, 
Card usage patterns, Device information, Account age, Card expiration date and Card 
issuing bank so on.
